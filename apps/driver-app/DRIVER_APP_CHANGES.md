- Uzbek language interface
- Clean, professional driver-focused design

## Driver Types Supported:
1. **Haydovchi** (Driver) - Regular taxi driver
2. **Dispetcher** (Dispatcher) - Dispatch coordinator
3. **Maxsus transport** (Special Transport) - Special vehicle operator
4. **Logist** (Logist) - Logistics specialist

## Technical Details

### Dependencies:
- All dependencies same as user-app (React Native, Expo, React Navigation, etc.)
- No additional packages required

### API Endpoints:
- Uses same backend API as user-app
- Driver-specific endpoints for rides and availability
- Profile includes `driver_type` field

### State Management:
- Uses same AuthContext structure
- Driver type stored in user profile
- Role field set to 'driver'

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements:
1. Add vehicle information collection
2. Implement document upload (license, registration)
3. Add earnings dashboard
4. Implement real-time ride notifications
5. Add map integration for navigation
6. Implement driver availability toggle
7. Add ride history with details
8. Implement rating and feedback system

### Backend Requirements:
- Ensure API supports `driver_type` field in user profile
- Implement driver-specific endpoints:
  - `/api/rides/available` - Get available rides
  - `/api/rides/:id/accept` - Accept a ride
  - `/api/rides/:id/start` - Start a ride
  - `/api/rides/:id/complete` - Complete a ride
  - `/api/rides/history` - Get ride history
